•	<b>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</b>
The DriverPass project was an ask from a Client to design a system for managing a Drivers Ed Business. This business would manage the driving and testing portions of Driver’s Ed. They wanted a cloud-based system that allowed for access from any internet-enabled device. 

•	<b>What did you do particularly well?</b>
Personally, I feel I took great care to listen to the client’s needs. The Client Interview and documentation provided gave the details needed to foresee the client’s immediate needs, and their future needs as the business scaled. 

•	<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b>
I would take extra care with the UML Class Diagram and finish building out the software architecture. I feel it is not fully completed. Since the class was a solo effort I feel I was missing perspectives needed to craft a fully fledged UML Class Diagram of the DriverPass system. 

•	<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b>
I utilized the Interview with the Client and leaned heavily upon the coursework and textbook to think about the Client’s needs from every vantage point. It is important to consider a user’s needs because a software implementation is not complete after the software is coded. The User Experience must be thoughtful and easy to use. Any system designed and implemented is not automatically accepted by endusers, it must be better than the existing system so that it’s worth going through the pains of implementation. 

•	<b>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</b>
Research, Research and more Research. Rarely is any software design created from scratch. It is often that others have left lessons in the form of documentation from projects prior to yours. In addition to Researching I find empathy goes a long way. With the problem in mind, walk through the experience of the enduser who’s using your tool to solve their problem. The more granular this walkthrough is the more enlightening it tends to be.
